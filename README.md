# push_swap
School 21 project

Algorithm tries three different approaches to sort stacks and chooses the best; First approach is to find longest sorted sequence in stack, then push everything else (searching for shortest ways to push between all elements) and push back (also calculating number of operations needed to push each of the elements from stack2 to stack 1). 

Another two algorithms divide stack to equal parts and sort each one of them using stack2. 

Bonuses: 
  -f for using file as input/output (no need to specify a file)
  -v to print stacks after each operation
  -c to do it in color
  -n to count operations needed to complete sorting 
  
Usage: enter flags and then unique numbers to be sorted
